# VerseReminder

An iOS app for Bible reading and verse tracking.

## Onboarding & Authentication

The app automatically signs users in anonymously with Firebase on first launch.
Progress is stored in Firestore under the user's UID and loaded as part of each
user's profile. Accounts can later be linked to Google or email using Firebase's
`link` API so progress can be synced across devices.
If the initial signâ€‘in fails due to a transient network error, the app will
automatically retry a few times and provide a "Retry" button so you can manually
attempt again.
